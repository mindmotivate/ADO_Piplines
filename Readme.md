# Disclaimer: Attention Azure DevOps Users

If you are encountering the following error in your Azure subscription and Organization:

````
(1 error)
(No hosted parallelism has been purchased or granted. To request a free parallelism grant, please fill out the following form https://aka.ms/azpipelines-parallelism-request)

````


Please take the following steps before initiating a new project in Azure DevOps. Special thanks to Ean Thompson for his valuable research on this topic.

## Resolution Steps:

1. Click on your Organization directory.

2. Select the Organization under which the project will be deployed.

3. Open Organization Settings, and under Pipelines, select "Parallel Jobs."

   - This page displays your subscription allotments. If there are 0 allotments for Microsoft-hosted Public or Private parallel jobs, you will encounter an error in your pipeline.

   - To troubleshoot, consider creating another Organization and checking the Parallel job allotments. In some cases, a second organization may allow up to 1800 minutes free. You can then build your pipeline in the organization with available allotments.

   - If the issue persists, check your subscription and request an allotment increase. Alternatively, fill out the error message form to request a free parallel job allotment.

Please be aware that the error may stem from the absence of granted parallelism, and the suggested steps aim to resolve this issue. If further assistance is required, feel free to consult Azure DevOps support or refer to additional resources in the Azure DevOps documentation.

# Pipleline Settings

## Change Defaults
By default, the option **"Disable creation of classic release pipelines"** is set to **"disabled."** Unfortunately, this default setting can be frustrating for users who require classic release pipelines. The same default setting also applies to classic build pipelines.

## Action Required
To address this issue and ensure the smooth functioning of your pipelines, it is imperative that you navigate to the organization settings in Azure DevOps and make the necessary changes. Please follow the steps below:

1. **Go to Organization Settings:**
   - Log in to your Azure DevOps account.
   - Navigate to the organization you are working on.

2. **Choose Pipelines:**
   - Within the organization settings, select the "Pipelines" option.

3. **Modify Default Settings:**
   - Look for the option **"Disable creation of classic release pipelines."**
   - Change the setting to **"enabled"** to allow the creation of classic release pipelines.

4. **Verify Classic Build Pipelines:**
   - Look for the option **"Disable creation of classic build pipelines."**
   - Change the setting to **"enabled"** to allow the creation of classic build pipelines.
 
## Why is This Important?
Adjusting these settings is crucial to ensure that you have the flexibility to work with classic release pipelines and classic build pipelines as needed for your projects. Failing to make these adjustments may lead to unnecessary challenges in your DevOps workflows.

## ***Make these changes at your earliest convenience to avoid any disruptions in your projects.***

5. **Additionally: Disable Triggers for Pull Requests:**
   - Ensure that triggers for building pull requests are turned off to fully implement the selected option. This step is crucial to align with your project's guidelines and control how your pipelines handle pull requests from forked repositories.
